# Install

To run E2E YAML scenarios you need:

1. **MCP server and app** — Same as for MCP usage. See [MCP — Install & connect](../mcp/) (server, Metro, Babel preset, idb/adb).
2. **Test runner** — `@ohah/react-native-mcp-test`. In this repo, run from the monorepo root:
   - Install deps: `bun install`
   - Build server: `bun run build`
   - Run YAML: `bun run test:yaml` (or use the runner CLI with your YAML path)

**idb (iOS)** and **adb (Android)** are required for tap, swipe, and screenshots. Install and verify as described in [MCP — Install & connect — Native tools](../mcp/#4-native-tools-idb--adb).
