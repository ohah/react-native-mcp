# Getting Started

Set up React Native MCP in your project in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **React Native** 0.72 or higher
- **Node.js** 18+ (or Bun)
- **idb** (iOS simulator) or **adb** (Android) — see [Install & connect](./)
- An **MCP client**: Cursor, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot CLI

---

## Step 1: Install and configure (30 seconds)

Run the CLI init command in your project root:

```bash
npx -y @ohah/react-native-mcp-server init
```

This auto-detects your project (React Native version, Expo, package manager) and:

1. Adds the Babel preset to `babel.config.js`
2. Creates the MCP server config for your client (Cursor, Claude, etc.)
3. Updates `.gitignore`

> Already set up manually? See [Install & connect](./) and [CLI Init](./cli-init) for details.

---

## Step 2: Run the app

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'rspress/theme';

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Bare RN">
```bash
# Start Metro
npx react-native start

# In another terminal, run on simulator/emulator

npx react-native run-ios

# or

npx react-native run-android

````
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Expo">
```bash
# Dev Client (recommended)
npx expo start --dev-client

# Or Expo Go (limited — see Expo Guide)
npx expo start
````

For Expo-specific details, see the [Expo Guide](./expo-guide).

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For Android emulator, set up port forwarding:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:12300 tcp:12300
```

---

## Step 3: Verify the connection

Open your MCP client and try:

> "Take a snapshot of the app"

If the AI returns a component tree, the connection is working. You can also verify with:

> "What's the debugger status?"

This calls `get_debugger_status` and should show `appConnected: true` with your device listed.
