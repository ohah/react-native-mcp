# Getting started

1. **Install** the MCP server and set up your app — see [Install & connect](./).
2. **Register** the server in your client (Cursor / Claude / Copilot) — see [Using MCP](./mcp-usage).
3. **Run** Metro and the app in the simulator or emulator.
4. In your AI client, use MCP tools (e.g. take_snapshot, tap, assert_text) to control and verify the app.

For detailed client setup, go to [Using MCP — Cursor, Claude Desktop, Copilot](./mcp-usage).
